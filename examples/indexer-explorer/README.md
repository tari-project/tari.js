# indexer-explorer

Browse on-chain substates using the Ootle indexer. No wallet, no signing, no local services — this is a pure **read** example that connects to the public Esmeralda testnet out of the box.

---

## What is this?

Tari Ootle is a smart contract platform. Every piece of on-chain state (accounts, vaults, component instances, resources) is stored as a **substate** — a key/value entry identified by a unique ID.

The **indexer** is a service that watches the network and indexes those substates so web apps can query them over HTTP. This example shows you how to:

- Connect to an indexer using the `IndexerProvider` from `@tari-project/ootle`
- Look up a specific substate by ID
- List recent substates and browse them by type

Think of the indexer like a blockchain explorer (e.g. Etherscan) — read-only, no wallet required.

## What you'll learn

- How to connect to the Ootle indexer from a React app
- How to query a substate by ID
- How to list and paginate recent substates
- The `useIndexer` React hook pattern used across Ootle dApp examples

## Before you start

### Install Node.js

You need **Node.js 18 or newer**. Check if you have it:

```bash
node --version
```

If not, download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (choose the LTS version).

### Install pnpm

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) instead of npm. Install it via:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

That's it — no local daemon or wallet required for this example.

---

## Run the example

In a terminal, from this directory:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

The public Esmeralda testnet indexer URL is pre-filled. Click **Connect to Indexer** — you should immediately start seeing recent substates.

---

## What you'll see

**Connect panel** — Shows the indexer URL and a "Esmeralda testnet · live" badge once connected. You can change the URL to point at a local indexer if you're running one.

**Substate lookup** — Enter any substate ID (e.g. `component_...` or `resource_...`) and click **Look up** to fetch and display it as formatted JSON.

**Recent substates list** — A table of the latest substates indexed, with coloured type badges:
- `component` — a deployed smart contract instance
- `resource` — a token type or other on-chain resource definition
- `vault` — a container holding tokens

Click any row to copy its ID into the lookup panel.

## Network information

| Network | Indexer URL |
|---------|------------|
| Esmeralda testnet (public) | `http://217.182.93.35:50124` |
| Local dev | `http://localhost:12500` |

To run a local indexer, see the [tari-ootle releases](https://github.com/tari-project/tari-ootle/releases).

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection failed" or network error**
The public indexer may be temporarily unavailable, or your network blocks HTTP (non-HTTPS) requests. Try refreshing after a moment. If you are behind a strict firewall or corporate VPN, the request to `217.182.93.35` may be blocked.

**CORS error in browser console**
Some browser configurations block cross-origin HTTP requests. Try a different browser, or run a local indexer at `http://localhost:12500` instead.

**Empty substate list**
The indexer may have just restarted and is catching up. Wait a moment and click **Connect** again.

**Substate lookup returns "not found"**
Substate IDs are case-sensitive and must be complete (no partial IDs). Double-check the ID you entered. You can find valid IDs by looking at the recent substates list or in the [Ootle explorer](https://ootle.tari.com).
