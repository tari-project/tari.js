title: Transaction Builder
description: Compose transaction instructions with a fluent API.
---

`TransactionBuilder` is a fluent, chainable API for constructing `UnsignedTransactionV1` objects. Instructions are appended in order and executed as a single batch on-chain.

## Create a builder

```ts
import { TransactionBuilder, Network } from "@tari-project/ootle";

const builder = TransactionBuilder.new(Network.Esmeralda);
```

## Build a transaction

A typical transaction: withdraw tokens from one account and deposit them into another.

```ts
const unsignedTx = TransactionBuilder.new(Network.Esmeralda)
  .feeTransactionPayFromComponent(accountAddress, 1000n)
  .callMethod(
    { componentAddress: accountAddress, methodName: "withdraw" },
    [{ Literal: resourceAddress }, { Literal: "500" }],
  )
  .saveVar("bucket")
  .callMethod(
    { componentAddress: recipientAddress, methodName: "deposit" },
    [{ Workspace: "bucket" }],
  )
  .buildUnsignedTransaction();
```

## Method reference

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `callFunction(func, args)` | Call a static function on a template |
| `callMethod(method, args)` | Call a method on a component |
| `createAccount(ownerPublicKey)` | Create a new account component |
| `createProof(account, resource)` | Create a resource proof |
| `claimBurn(claim, outputData)` | Claim a Minotari burn |
| `saveVar(name)` | Save last output to workspace |
| `feeTransactionPayFromComponent(addr, amount)` | Add fee instruction |
| `feeTransactionPayFromComponentConfidential(addr, proof)` | Confidential fee |
| `allocateAddress(type, name)` | Pre-allocate an address |
| `addInput(req)` / `withInputs(reqs)` | Add substate inputs |
| `withMinEpoch(n)` / `withMaxEpoch(n)` | Set epoch bounds |
| `withInstructions(instructions)` | Append raw instructions |
| `withFeeInstructions(instructions)` | Append raw fee instructions |
| `dropAllProofsInWorkspace()` | Drop all proofs |
| `buildUnsignedTransaction()` | Return the finished unsigned tx |

## Mutable builder pattern

All methods return `this`, so you can chain calls. The builder mutates its internal state — each call appends to the same instruction list:

```ts
// These are equivalent:
const tx1 = builder.callMethod(a, argsA).callMethod(b, argsB).buildUnsignedTransaction();

builder.callMethod(a, argsA);
builder.callMethod(b, argsB);
const tx2 = builder.buildUnsignedTransaction();
```
